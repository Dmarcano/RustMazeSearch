# RustMazeSearch 

A small CLI program that solves Mazes built from given text files. Built for the purpose of learning Rust programming.

* Opens a text file that represents in a maze as open cells or wall cells

* Searches the maze using either depth-first-search or breadth-first-search

* Performs a function on each maze cell as the search goes on (in this case its to display the current position in the search)
